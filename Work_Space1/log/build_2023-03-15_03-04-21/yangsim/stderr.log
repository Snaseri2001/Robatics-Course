[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:11 (find_package):
  By not providing
  "Findhome/soroush/robatics/Assignment2/assi2/interfaces.cmake" in
  CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has asked CMake to find a package
  configuration file provided by
  "home/soroush/robatics/Assignment2/assi2/interfaces", but CMake did not
  find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by
  "home/soroush/robatics/Assignment2/assi2/interfaces" with any of the
  following names:

    home/soroush/robatics/Assignment2/assi2/interfacesConfig.cmake
    home/soroush/robatics/assignment2/assi2/interfaces-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of
  "home/soroush/robatics/Assignment2/assi2/interfaces" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH
  or set "home/soroush/robatics/Assignment2/assi2/interfaces_DIR" to a
  directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "home/soroush/robatics/Assignment2/assi2/interfaces" provides a separate
  development package or SDK, be sure it has been installed.
